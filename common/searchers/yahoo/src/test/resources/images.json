The Coast Guard HC-130 was responsible for harmonizing efforts of 23 military aircraft, scheduling refueling, logging the positions of survivors in need of rescue, prioritizing recoveries and tasking rescue aircraft. The HC-130 crew also ensured safe transit of all aircraft to and from the predetermined drop point dubbed “cloverleaf” where survivors were transferred for medical attention.

Air Station Clearwater launched the HC-130 which arrived in New Orleans and acted as the on-scene coordinator for search and rescue missions in the area. The Coast Guard HC-130 was responsible for harmonizing efforts of 23 military aircraft, scheduling refueling, logging the positions of survivors in need of rescue, prioritizing recoveries and tasking rescue aircraft. The HC-130 crew also ensured safe transit of all aircraft to and from the predetermined drop point dubbed “cloverleaf” where survivors were transferred for medical attention. Pictured here is a Coast Guard Jayhawk helicopter conducting hoist operations. As of the morning of 1 September, Coast Guard helicopters have rescued over 1,700 people from rooftops in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Please note: This photo was used in a brief to the Commandant, there's an excellent chance the junior officer who built the brief took it off the wire. I didn't take it. Maybe the photo was taken by a member of the Coast Guard in another aircraft, but I don't know. Unless a Coastie took it, it's likely copyrighted. I post it here under quot;fair use quot; and as a public service, letting you -- the public -- know about the dire situation in New Orleans.","clickurl":"http://static.flickr.com/30/39252554_1dd76d3f4c.jpg","date":"2005/09/01","filename":"39252554_1dd76d3f4c.jpg","format":"jpeg","height":"500","mimetype":"image/jpeg","refererclickurl":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/tidewatermuse/39252554/","refererurl":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/tidewatermuse/39252554/","size":"38400","thumbnail_height":"145","thumbnail_url":"http://sp1.yt-thm-a04.yimg.com/image/25/f10/504696737","thumbnail_width":"110","title":"Coast

New Orleans and the lack of response by our government was unforgivable and it continues to this day. In May of 2006, I went to New Orleans and saw for myself the condition of things after 8 months of supposed renewal. The victims of this hurricane rely on charities and their own hard work to renew their cities and towns. Lori Baker a href= http://www.flickr.com/photos/zellie/ www.flickr.com/photos/zellie/ /a and Eric Harvey Brown a href= http://www.flickr.com/photos/dogseat www.flickr.com/photos/dogseat /a put together this incredible book called Sign of Life:Surving Katrina. I was lucky enough to have one of my photos included in the book. 100% of the proceeds go to two charities still working in the gulf region.
