        At LittleShoot, we believe the Internet is the most powerful <span class="highlightText">tool for free speech</span> the world has ever known.  This struck me, Adam Fisk, the co-founder of LittleShoot, 
        on the first Internet site I ever visited: the site for the African National Congress (ANC), the organization led by Nelson Mandela dedicated to the overthrowing of Apartheid.  

        On the level playing field of the Internet, the ANC could speak just as loudly as anyone else, and the Internet helped them spread their message to the world.  What an amazing new tool 
        for <span class="highlightText">democracy</span>!  I was in college at the time, and I had just set up an independent study to build my own radio transmitter to start broadcasting a "pirate" signal in 
        Providence, RI.  After seeing the World Wide Web, though, it was clear this <span class="highlightText">Tim Berners-Lee</span> guy, the inventor of the initial World Wide Web standards, had created a transmitter 
        far more powerful.  I scrapped the independent study and started taking every computer science class I could.
        <br><br>
        LittleShoot is the most powerful transmitter I can imagine.  After working for four years as the lead engineer at LimeWire, I started 
        LittleShoot to <span class="highlightText">overcome all of LimeWire's shortcomings</span>, from ease of use to legal issues to the underlying technology.  The result is a 
        <span class="highlightText">standards-based peer-to-peer</span> application  
        that works <span class="highlightText">directly from your browser</span> with the most powerful searching, publishing, and downloading technology available today.  
        <br><br>
        LittleShoot is far more than just a powerful transmitter.  It's also a receiver, and it can find new signals.  In many ways, it's <span class="highlightText">like Google for files instead of web pages</span>, but that 
        doesn't cover the transmitting.  With LittleShoot, publishing your content is clicks away, and you don't have to wait for it to upload anywhere.
        <br><br>
        Breaking this down further, LittleShoot is a tool for:

        <ol>
            <li>Publishing (transmitting)</li>
            <li>Searching (finding new signals)</li>
            <li>Downloading (receiving)</li>
        </ol>

        LittleShoot provides optimal solutions to all three problems using the best of peer-to-peer and centralized technologies.  We give you complete control over 
        publishing and distribution of Internet media, all using <span class="highlightText">open protocols</span> 
        and <span class="highlightText">open standards</span> and released as <span class="highlightText">open source</span> software.
        
        <br><br>
        
        Let's start with <span class="highlightText">searching</span>.  When you search with LittleShoot, you can find all the media files everyone else on the network is sharing, all right
        within your browser.  Here's what search results look like:
        
        <br><br>
        <img src="http://littleshootimages.appspot.com/images/whatIsBigIdeaSearch.jpg" width="588"/>
        <br><br>
        
        If you want to become an active participant in the network, to <span class="highlightText">disseminate</span> your knowledge, you have to <span class="highlightText">publish</span>.  It couldn't be easier.  Just click the "Browse..."
        button and select your file, and it's published to the world.  You don't need to upload it or anything -- your file is immediately available in search results
        because it's already on your computer.  With LittleShoot, that's all we need.
        
        <br><br>
        
        Here's what your LittleShoot publish page looks like:<br><br>
        
        <br><br>
        <img src="http://littleshootimages.appspot.com/images/whatIsBigIdeaPublish.gif" width="579"/>
        <br><br>
        
        Finally, when you actually go to download, you simply click on links in the download window.  Behind the scenes, LittleShoot efficiently downloads the
        file using our peer-to-peer platform, but to you it appears and acts like any other link from a "normal" web page.
        <br><br>
        Together, we hope these simple building blocks -- intentionally as simple as possible -- contribute to the "welfare of the public" Hugo Black referred to
        so many years ago.

    <span class="normalMedium">
        LittleShoot uses centralized search to quickly search all the files available on the network.  This is in contrast to other "peer-to-peer"
        systems where searching is distributed across the network.  The result is far more results for you, and you get them faster.  You can search by file name or by tags.

        LittleShoot is Fast<br><br>
    </span>
    <span class="normalMedium">
        We already mentioned one reason our search is fast, but it's also fast because the LittleShoot 
        plugin caches results.  This means when you click through your searches, your browser is usually accessing results information already on your computer
        instead of going through the Internet again.  The Internet is slow compared to your computer. 
        You'll notice it when you click through the pages of your search results.  They'll appear almost instantly.

    <span class="normalMedium">
        When you click to download a file, you actually get different parts of that file from all the other users on the network who have any part of it.  
        While it seems like you're clicking on any other old link in a browser, there's magic behind the scenes.  All the computers on the LittleShoot 
        network are cooperating as a seamless whole.  Each computer contributes a little bit of his or her bandwidth to the entire system.  Together though, 
        that bandwidth adds up quickly, ultimately creating an incredibly powerful and robust system for file distribution.  Because everyone contributes to 
        the system, you're able to get much higher resolution videos and photos than you can with centralized systems.

        With LittleShoot, you get files from the most efficient sources available.  If there's someone sitting next to you in a cafe with the file you want, 
        LittleShoot immediately recognizes that, and you start getting the file at lightning speed from that person.  We're also working on keeping traffic
        within ISPs.  This means if you're on Time Warner's New York network, you'll first access sources also on Time Warner's New York network.

        LittleShoot opens files directly.  For video files, for example, you don't need to download the entire file and then look at it.  Instead, LittleShoot 
        immediately opens it and shows it to you in your browser.  The same with photos, pdfs or any other type of file.  LittleShoot just opens it.

<div class="contentBodySection whatIsSection" id="whatIsSecurity" style="display:none;" title="Security">
    <span class="normalMedium">
        <span class="normalBoldMedium">Introduction</span> 
        <br><br>
        LittleShoot takes security very seriously and includes a number of precautions to ensure you can use LittleShoot safely.  We recognize that P2P opens up the
        potential for new security holes, and we continually monitor any theoretical and actual attacks on LittleShoot to protect our users.  Our security framework 
        is described in more detail below.
        
        <br><br><br>
        <span class="normalBoldMedium">Localhost Only</span> 
        <br><br>
        LittleShoot's first line of defense is to only accept requests from the local computer.  This means that whatever requests are made to LittleShoot, they have to be made 
        from another program running on the same computer that LittleShoot is running on.  LittleShoot is an HTTP server (among other things), and it uses a simple Java servlet filter on all calls
        to ensure they come from the local computer.  File uploads are the one exception, a case described below.
        
        <br><br><br>
        <span class="normalBoldMedium">File Uploads</span> 
        <br><br>
        One of LittleShoot's functions is to allow you to share files with other users.  For this to work, you have to allow file requests from other machines to go through.
        LittleShoot keeps you protected even in this case.  First, LittleShoot only shares files through their unique SHA-1 hash.  Each file has a unique hash, and only the 
        files you've explicitly tell LittleShoot to share are available on the network by that hash.  Any other file on your computer cannot be shared because LittleShoot doesn't know anything 
        about them.  Because LittleShoot uses hashes instead of file paths for serving files, attackers cannot attempt to download sensitive files using obscure file paths.  Attackers also 
        cannot use a brute-force attack to guess random hashes to access sensitive data because LittleShoot doesn't access any files except the ones you explicitly tell it to share.
        
        <br><br><br>
        <span class="normalBoldMedium">Publishing</span> 
        <br><br>
        Because the LittleShoot site allows you to publish files, some extra precautions are necessary.  LittleShoot protects you
        to ensure only the files you specify can ever be published.  First, LittleShoot takes advantage of the browser's "single origin policy" using HTTP POST requests
        to obtain temporary Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) keys for publishing.  LittleShoot uses these keys to sign requests from the browser to the LittleShoot client.  Because browsers only 
        allow POST requests to the site your browser is currently on, you can only publish files when
        you're on the LittleShoot site.  
        <br><br>
        So that prevents other sites from trying to publish your files without your knowledge.  Then, however, LittleShoot needs to protect you from other
        theoretical attacks on publishing.  You might be on an open wireless network, for example, where other people on the network could be spying on your traffic.  They can easily steal 
        the temporary key the LittleShoot servers issue to allow you to publish your files.  This fortunately doesn't get them very far, however, because of the first line
        of defense described above: LittleShoot only accepts requests from the machine it's running on.  Other machines on the local wireless network cannot make calls to
        tell LittleShoot to publish something, even if they have the temporary key, because LittleShoot just ignores any calls from other computers.  The keys issued
        for publishing are also only valid for a matter of seconds -- they expire and are useless almost immediately.
        
        <br><br><br>
        <span class="normalBoldMedium">Conclusion</span> 
        <br><br>
        At LittleShoot we recognize that building a secure application can be a moving target.  There's always the possibility of an attack we haven't thought of, but we diligently 
        will continue to analyze our architecture for any possibly vulnerabilities.  If you can't use LittleShoot securely, you might as well not use it at all.  Your security is our highest priority.
