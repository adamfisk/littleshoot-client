        How do I search?<br><br>
    </span>
    <span class="normalMedium">
        To search for a file, you simply enter a search term in the search field and either press "Enter" or click the "Search" button.  If you 
        want to limit the search to specific media types, you can select the specific media types you want in the check boxes.

        LittleShoot is, well, little.  While we hope someday we'll grow up to be big, there's not that much content out there 
        while the network is still small.  We're a LittleShoot with big dreams.

        My friend published a file, but I don't see it. Why?<br><br>
    </span>
    <span class="normalMedium">
        LittleShoot only shows the files available from users currently on the network.  If your friend turned off 
        his or her computer and they were the only source for that file, it will not be available until he or she comes back online.

    <span class="normalBoldMedium">
        How do I download?<br><br>
    </span>
    <span class="normalMedium">
        To download a file, you simply click on its link in search results.  This is <span class="highlightText">just like clicking on any other link</span> on any other web page, 
        although behind the scenes the LittleShoot plugin is working its magic and downloading different parts of the file 
        from every available user on the network.

    <span class="normalBoldMedium">
        Can I save the files I download?<br><br>
    </span>
    <span class="normalMedium">
        LittleShoot by default saves files to your Shared folder in your home directory on your computer, so you can always get it from there.  
        With file types the browser doesn't display directly, you can also choose where to download to from the browser window.

    <span class="normalBoldMedium">
        How do I publish a file?<br><br>
    </span>
    <span class="normalMedium">
        To publish, select the "Browse..." button from either the home page or the "Publish" page.  Then select a file to publish from the dialog that appears.<br><br>
        
        Once you've selected a file, you will then be prompted to <span class="highlightText">add "tags" to the file</span>.   Tags are descriptive words describing your file.  When other 
        users search, your file will come up if their search term matches one of your tags.  
        Once you publish the file, other users on the network can immediately search for it and download it.
        <br><br><br>
    </span>

    <span class="normalBoldMedium">
        What are tags?<br><br>
    </span>
    <span class="normalMedium">
        Tags are other words people can use to find your file.  If you're publishing a photo of yourself kayaking in Guatemala, for example, you might add the tags 
        "kayak" and "Guatemala".  Even if your photo is called "Me and Billy.jpg", people searching for "kayak" will still see it in their search results.

    <span class="normalBoldMedium">
        Do I have to upload the file?<br><br>
    </span>
    <span class="normalMedium">
        No, your files always stay on your computer.  When other users download them, they get them from your computer and themselves become another source for the file.

        The LittleShoot <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/littleshooters/">forum</a>

        LittleShoot always runs in the background on my computer. Why?<br><br>
    </span>
    <span class="normalMedium">
        LittleShoot runs in the background to make the files you publish always available.  In addition, you become a source for the 
        files you download.  LittleShoot is a cooperative system.  Each user contributes a little bandwidth serving their files.  
        Everyone contributing a little bit of bandwidth quickly adds up to a lot of bandwidth for the whole LittleShoot network, 
        though, so everyone contributing a little allows everyone to enjoy a network that performs well when you go to download 
        files yourself.  The LittleShoot network united together creates an optimized system for distributing your files and your 
        friends' files cheaply and easily.<br><br><br>

    <span class="normalBoldMedium">
        Is LittleShoot legal?<br><br>
    </span>
    
    <span class="normalMedium">
        The short answer is yes.  The long answer is more involved.  First and foremost, LittleShoot is not a tool for distributing 
        copyrighted content.  If you don't own the copyright to a file or are unsure of the copyright restrictions on a file, you shouldn't publish it,
        and you shouldn't download it.  LittleShoot adheres to copyright law and something you may have heard of called the "Digital Millennium Copyright Act," 
        or the "DMCA."  Under the DMCA, a copyright holder can ask us to take down links to files they own the copyright to.  
        When we receive valid takedown notices, we will remove the content in question.  Also, if we see a file on the network 
        we know our users don't own the copyright to, we'll remove it from the system as soon as we're aware of it.  Finally, 
        we just don't think that's a particularly interesting use for the technology.  
        We see LittleShoot as a tool to give you better access to the knowledge of the world.<br><br><br>
