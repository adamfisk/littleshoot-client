There's all sorts of stuff going on here.  First, we added the images app to facilitate relative paths in combined css files generated by app engine path.  See:

http://code.google.com/p/app-engine-patch/issues/detail?id=90#c10

This means we had to copy all of the files from our jquery them into the images/media directory.  NOTE -- not sure this is actually functional anymore with so many changes -- double-check


Quick note on the state of publishing, as of 4/25/09:

When we left off, the issue was still user registration.  App Engine Patch by default uses paths from the registration module, which we stopped including because we reached the 1000 file limit.  Maybe we can add it back as a zip import?  We don't really need it, though -- maybe we can override the App Engine Patch paths instead?
