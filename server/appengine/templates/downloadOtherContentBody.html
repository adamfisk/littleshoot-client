            You're on Linux or another Unix, so we trust you know what you're
            doing.  Our installer is currently just a tgz that you can 
            expand in, say, /usr/local or wherever you like using:
            <br><br>
            sudo tar xzvf LittleShoot-[version].tgz
            <br><br>
            We'll eventually include a more sophisticated script that will 
            likely do things like prompt you if you'd like us to create an
            entry in init.d, but for now you have to run it manually.
            
            <br><br>
            
            First, navigate to the LittleShoot directory with:<br><br>
            
            cd LittleShoot-{version}<br><br>
            
            Then you can start LittleShoot with:<br><br>
            
            nohup ./run.sh &<br><br>
            
            or without nohup, without backgrounding, etc as you prefer.<br><br>
            
            Once LittleShoot is running, go back to the web site <a href="http://www.littleshoot.org">here</a>.

            If you'd like to lend a hand with creating a more sophisticated 
            installer for general Unix flavors or for any specific variety, 
            feel free to pipe up over on the
