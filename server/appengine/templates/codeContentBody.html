    Building and running LittleShoot is generally easy, although the build process does take 
    time because there's a lot going on in there. To build LittleShoot, you first need to have both 
    <a href="http://maven.apache.org/">maven</a> and <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">ant</a> installed.
    To checkout and run LittleShoot, simply perform the following.
    
    {% include "buildSteps.html" %}

    <strong>NOTE:</strong> Compiling on Windows has become a challenge due to the influx of native code. You need to have Visual Studio, OpenSSL, PowerShell, etc, but 
    you should get the appropriate error messages if anything is missing.
    Linux does not compile due to all the non-Linux platform-specific code. We'll remedy both in the future.
