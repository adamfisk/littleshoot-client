            LittleShoot is a completely self-funded startup dedicated to making it possible for anyone, large or small, to distribute their content cheaply and 
            efficiently on the Internet.  Adam Fisk, the former lead engineer at LimeWire, brought together the LittleShoot team to carry out his vision of a   
            peer-to-peer (p2p) network based on open standards and focused on integrating p2p with the core fabric of the Internet at the protocol level.

            LittleShoot is small, and the world is big and often harsh.  LittleShoot needs constant care.  This is where Adam comes in, 
            attending daily to LittleShoot's every need.  His main focus is the water.  It's amazing how much water the little guy needs.  
            Overwatering is also a constant danger.

            <br><br>
            Jerry focuses on the roots.  Is LittleShoot's growing environment optimal?  Does the little fella' need 
            more nitrogen or more phosphorous?  Possibly less?  These are the questions the haunt Jerry late into the night.  It's an obsession.  He 
            also carries a lot of heavy fertilizer bags.  We're not sure you can tell from the picture, but Jerry has a fantastic body as a result.

            LittleShoot originally started out as a team of 5, including our great friends <a href="http://www.artvote.com/">Brendan Klinger</a>, Yusuke Naito, and 
            <a href="http://www.onliness.org/douglasprice/">Douglas Price</a>.  It soon became 
            clear that the technical challenges of LittleShoot would take much longer than we anticipated, though, and Brendan, Yusuke, and Doug often found 
            themselves playing the card game <a href="http://www.pagat.com/marriage/pintip.html">pinochle</a> as they waited for Adam and Jerry to finish their latest crazy coding scheme.  
            After the 10,000th game of pinochle (which Yusuke won in dramatic fashion), we had quite a party, and Brendan, Yusuke, and Doug decided to move on and to rejoin the LittleShoot 
            team when the time was ripe.  Much of what you see of LittleShoot is the result of their work.  Hopefully, the time for them
            to come back on board is just around the corner!
