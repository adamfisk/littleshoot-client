OSX
The postflight script in install/osx/LittleShoot is the one that's used!!!

Not sure if we can just get rid of the other though

The jsmooth stuff can be confusing as hell.  The littleshoot.jsmooth
file *is generated* during the build -- in temp_install_dir/trunk/install/win

To build the Windows installer, you need makensis from the NSIS
installer on your path.
