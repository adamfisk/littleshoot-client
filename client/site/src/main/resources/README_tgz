Welcome to LittleShoot!  

To run LittleShoot, simply type ./run.sh from your shell.  You need to 
have Java installed.  On Ubuntu with multiverse enabled, you can install 
Java with:

apt-get install sun-java5-jre

There's also some fancy Java 6 install for Feisty Fawn, although I have 
yet to play around with that.  

We realize this install system is rudimentary. If you'd like to 
help build  a deb or an rpminstaller, please feel free to contact 
me at a@lastbamboo.org.  

As you likely know, LittleShoot is open source and is designed for 
easy developer participation.  In particular, the source tree is carefully
organized into many different projects, allowing you to dig in to the code
where you might be particularly productive.

If you're a JavaScript hacker, check out the lastbamboo/trunk/client/site
or the lastbamboo/trunk/server/site projects.  There's all sorts of 
JavaScript to play with there.

If databases are your thing, check out the server and the cleint db projects.
Both use Hibernate.  

If you're familiar with p2p and NAT traversal, or possibly with IETF standards
like SIP, STUN, TURN, and ICE, feel free to check out those projects on the
client.

If you're not feeling up to hacking around on the source tree, feel free to 
look around and to play with any projects that look interesting, or just
keep using LittleShoot!

Finally, we're not at all precious about our approach or current setup.  
We've worked hard to design what we think is the optimal system for media
distribution on the Internet, but part of achieving that goal is staying 
open to any new developments and ideas.  From a code architecture perspective, 
we also recognize there are always areas we could improve.  We have our own
reusable NIO library in LittleShoot right now, for example, but I have to
believe MINA does a better job.  We'll eventually use MINA.  We're open to
any better way of doing things along those lines, so please speak up!
 
Finally, LittleShoot is 100% internally funded.  We haven't taken any outside
investment in large part because as soon as we do, investors' interests compete
with users' interests.  You, as a user and a participant in the LittleShoot 
community, are and always will be our top priority.   

Thanks.
